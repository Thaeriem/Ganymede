# Rendering Ganymede
Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, is a captivating celestial object and is known for its unique features like its sub-surface salt water ocean and scientific significance. This project aims to create an immersive visual experience of Ganymede and Jupiter using Three.js and TypeScript. In this process, we used the spin and axial tilt of both Ganymede and Jupiter in the visualization and represented the relative distance between them scaled down to roughly 30%. Both celestial bodies have their normal and specular maps overlayed to attempt to reflect the real-life visage of these celestial bodies.
